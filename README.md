## Overview
This project is a **subscription order summary card** for a fictional music streaming service.

The interface features:
- A clean and modern UI

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

## My Process
1. Started by structuring the layout using **semantic HTML containers**.  
2. Applied **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to align and center components efficiently.  
3. Used **CSS variables** to keep color management clean and reusable.  
4. Imported a custom Google Font to match the challenge’s design.  
5. Added styles for hover and focus states for better accessibility and feedback.  
6. Implemented a **fully responsive layout**, adapting the background and spacing for small screens.
